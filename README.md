# App
- ToDo
  - [x] Get all data in the repo
  - [x] Normalize all data
  - [x] Add data filter functionality for each dataset
  - [x] Calculate Correlation Coefficients
  - [x] First: Find more data that correlates with housing price index (Government Policies/Subsidies? Consumer confidence polls?)
  - [x] Second: Create a predictor model with housing price index as the target variable
  - [x] Add date filter
  - [x] Add Region filter
  - [x] Update correlation table on filter
  - [x] Should we add a different tab for localized data? So one tab is US/Federal level and the other tab is local state or ZIP code level?
  - [x] Order the Correlation Coefficients in descending order
  - [x] Clean up the title of the graph
  - [x] Implement a predictor model on either federal or regional level (bigger task)
  - [ ]  Calculate Correlation Coefficients for local data
